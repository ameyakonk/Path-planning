# 8-puzzle-solver-using-BFS

## Overview
The repository contains the following contents.

1. Source code to run the 8-puzzle solver.
2. Output Text files generated from the code for two different test cases. 

I have used two test cases having their respective start and goal states

a. start1 = [1, 4, 7, 0, 2, 8, 3, 5, 6]
   goal1 = [1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 0]
 
b. start2 = [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 8, 6]
